            I hear babies cry <br>
            I watch them grow <br>
            They'll learn much more <br>
            Than I'll ever know <br>
            And I think to myself <br>
            What a wonderful world <br>
            Yes, I think to myself <br>
            What a wonderful world <br>
            Ooh, yes <br>
        </p>
