<h2> The history</h2>
<p> The history of Pavlodar region is <strong>really long</strong>. <br>
  Let's start with the city - Pavlodar.           Some people make <em>mistake</em> when says, that Pavlodar was estimated in 1720. Because the place was not only a city, it was <strong>the capital</strong> of Kimak kaganat and the name was <strong>Khakan-Kimak</strong> that was estimated in IX century. Who knows maybe the city was even more centries ago. But <em>the first mention</em> was in IX century by Al-Idrisi. <br>
  The next is Bayanaul that has <strong>huge history</strong>. There were born many Kazakh batyrs, intelligentsia. There is no doubt why Bayanaul has many creative poeple. Just look at the pictures below <br>
